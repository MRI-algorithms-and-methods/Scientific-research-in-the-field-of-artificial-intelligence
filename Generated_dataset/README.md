Synthetic MRI Dataset
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a synthetic MRI dataset with 23,329 samples (T1, T2, and PD contrasts), split into:

Train: 16,867 samples

Test: 6,462 samples

Due to GitHub file size restrictions, only example files are included here. The full dataset is available via the link below.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into train and test folders with identical structures.

1. k_space
raw/:

.h5 files containing raw k-space data.

sorted/:

.npy files with k-space data sorted using the filling order (see ps/ks_order/*.json).

2. phantoms
.h5 files with phantom data (shape: (250, 250, 5)), including 5 channels:

T1, T2, T2*, PD, and D.

3. ps (Pulse Sequence)
parameters/:

.json files with pulse sequence parameters.

seq/:

.seq pulse sequence files.

wave/:

.npy files representing interpreted pulse sequences in waveform style.

ks_order/:

.json files defining k-space filling order.

param_encode/:

Digitally encoded pulse sequence parameters for DL model input.

4. reconstructed
Reconstructed MR images in two formats:

.png for visualization.

.npy for DL training/testing.

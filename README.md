The project focuses on developing a platform for generating realistic synthetic MRI data, which can be used for various applied tasks. 

The platform consists of several blocks: 

- **Data Collection Block** — Collects real MRI data with annotations, tissue physical parameters, and information about magnetic field inhomogeneities, noise, and artifacts.
- **[Digital Phantom Creation Block ](https://github.com/MRI-algorithms-and-methods/Scientific-research-in-the-field-of-artificial-intelligence/tree/main/MRI_phantom)** — Using the collected data, digital phantoms are created, on which artifact, noise, and inhomogeneity effects are added using AI and diffusion models.
- **[MRI Data Synthesis Block(pipeline)](https://github.com/MRI-algorithms-and-methods/Scientific-research-in-the-field-of-artificial-intelligence/tree/main/pipeline)** — Synthesizing additional MRI data using an MRI scanner simulator and pulse sequences developed by the team. For  an example of such synthetic data refere to **[Generated_dataset](https://github.com/MRI-algorithms-and-methods/Scientific-research-in-the-field-of-artificial-intelligence/tree/main/Generated_dataset)** used for training **[DL-based  Bloch simulator](https://github.com/MRI-algorithms-and-methods/Scientific-research-in-the-field-of-artificial-intelligence/tree/main/DL-based_Bloch_simulator)**
- **Validation Block** — Testing the platform on applied tasks, such as data reconstruction for ultra-low-field MRI using deep learning algorithms.

The project involves collaboration with NIITFA and JET LAB LLC, as well as close interaction with the international scientific community.

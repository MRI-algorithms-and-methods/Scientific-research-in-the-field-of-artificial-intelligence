## Our project:
The project focuses on developing a platform for generating realistic synthetic MRI data, which can be used for various applied tasks. 

The platform consists of several blocks:

- **Data Collection Block** — Collects real MRI data with annotations, tissue physical parameters, and information about magnetic field inhomogeneities, noise, and artifacts.
- **[Digital Phantom Creation Block](https://github.com/MRI-algorithms-and-methods/Scientific-research-in-the-field-of-artificial-intelligence/tree/main/pipeline)** — Using the collected data, digital phantoms are created, on which artifact, noise, and inhomogeneity effects are added using AI and diffusion models.
- **MRI Data Synthesis Block** — Synthesizing additional MRI data using an MRI scanner simulator and pulse sequences developed by the team.
- **Validation Block** — Testing the platform on applied tasks, such as data reconstruction for ultra-low-field MRI using deep learning algorithms.

The project involves collaboration with NIITFA and JET LAB LLC, as well as close interaction with the international scientific community.

## Tasks:

1. Collect a set of real MRI data of various organs with marking (norm/pathology)
2. Review methods for creating digital phantoms based on a literature review
3. Conduct an experimental comparison of existing classical methods for creating digital phantoms
4. Review modern AI methods suitable for increasing the realism of digital phantoms.
5. Develop an AI method for increasing the realism of digital phantoms (open source)
6. Submit at least 5 applications for the grant competition of the Committee for Science and Higher Education of St. Petersburg
7. Submit at least 5 applications for the scholarship competition of the President of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Russian Federation
8. Present at least 5 scientific reports at the Scientific and Educational-Methodological Conference of ITMO University and at the Congress of Young Scientists
